const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysis of requirements = "The second phase of which the developer or team of developers ensure whatever systems that are in place fits pefectly for their project and any functional requirements"

const Design = "The third phase where developers making sure their operations have necessary features, minute details, etc. To ensure the consumers satisfaction is met"

const Testing and integration = "The next stage is testing and integration where the developer itself can actually run codes and test the waters"

const implementation = "The follow stages is cohesive to the previous one where this one is where the main codes are coming into play from all the preperation"

const maintaining = "The final stage is where the team is keeping in check of their final project by updating, and ensuring no bugs come to their codes"
